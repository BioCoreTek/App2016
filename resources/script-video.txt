Team!
The uplink to the Aura has been restored.

The primary objective for your team is as follows:

The Aura station hosts BioCoreTekâ€˜s revolutionary Artificial Intelligence technology.
It is *imperative* that you retrieve this technology and return it to us. 

You are looking for a small chip with the BioCoreTek logo on it.
It will be integrated within the interface medium in the core processor of the station. 

Time is of the essence.
Get it done!

Your team will only be compensated when you return the chip to Earth.
